						<h1>Package</h1>
						<p>Xiaomi Mi A1 comes in a minimalistic box that was inspired by Apple. A simple white box with multiple layers, presents the Xiaomi's logo and the information, that this is an Android One smartphone. That means, it has stock Android without MIUI. In addition to the device itself, the package also includes a needle for ejecting the SIM or memory card slot, the European 2A charger adapter, the charging cable with USB-C connector and basic documentation. The whole package is simple and minimalistic.</p>
					</td>
					
					<td>
						<h1>Camera</h1>
						<p>Xiaomi Mi A1 has 12+12 Mpx dual rear camera with 2x optical zoom and two-tone LED flash.  There is also the possibility to use HDR and Portrait mode. The resulting photos in good light conditions are good, colorful and vivid. But in low light it doesn't do as well. Photos have digital noise, poor quality and colors. With HDR on it's better, but not much. Video quality is not bad, but image stabilization is missing. Most of these "problems" can be solved by installing an external camera app - Google Camera.</p>
					</td>
					
					<td>
						<h1>Android One</h1>
						<p>Xiaomi Mi A1 does not include the standard MIUI extension as is normal in Xiaomi phones but there is Android One instead. It is stock Android without extension with direct support from Google. Exactly how it is in Google Pixel. Advantages are system smoothness, early and regular updates and support directly from Google. The disadvantage is that Android One does not contain any extra applications like in MIUI, except the basic ones from Google.</p>

						<h1>Design and construction</h1>
						<p>The device offers a high-quality, slim and stylish metal body that makes the Xiaomi Mi A1 similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. Its dimensions are 155.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm and the weight is 165g. On the front side is a 5.5-inch Full HD display, 3 navigation buttons, a speaker, a light sensor, a front selfie camera and a notification LED.  On the back side we can find a fingerprint sensor, camera and LED flash. On the bottom is the USB C connector, 3.5mm jack and speaker. At the top is IrDA. And on the right side there are volume control buttons and a lock button.</p>
					</td>

					<td>
						<h1>Performance and battery</h1>
						<p>Eight-core processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 with the graphics accelerator Adreno 506 will take care of the performance. We can find the same chip in Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 4X, Redmi 5 Plus or Mi Max 2. That means the performance is enough for the average user. It can handle most of the games from Google Play, but in more demanding 3D games it is necessary to reduce details. Battery has the capacity of 3080 mAh. It lasts around one day. Phone also supports fast charging so it takes about 90 minutes to charge from 0% to 100%.</p>
					</td>

					<td>
						<h1>Conclusion</h1>
						<p>The Xiaoimi Mi A1 is a really good alternative for those who want a mid-range device with good performance, nice design, average battery and a good price.  Disadvantages of this device are missing NFC, worse photos in low light conditions. Otherwise it is very good phone with a great price of 150 €. And even after 2 years of use, I have no problem with it and I would buy it again.</p>
